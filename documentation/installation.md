# Enabling GM on your server
This is a very easy process:
1. When ready, go [here](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=560223567967551519&permissions=8&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdigmsl.link%2Fgreenmesa&scope=bot)
2. Make sure your account can manage the target server
3. In the drop down menu select the target server
4. Leave the admin permission that should be checked as it is for the bot to function properly.
5. Click authorize to complete the process
*NOTE:* When you click authorize you are _authorizing_ GM to access your server with full administrator privileges, understand that I will **not** be held liable to your feelings and we will have a *happy*, ***healthy*** relationship.

This doc is part of the `invite` command. This Node.js bot was made with the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) (major library good for constructing big or small Discord apps).
